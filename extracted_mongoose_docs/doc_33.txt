Mongoose ODM v7.8.6 Fork me on GitHub Mongoose Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js Read the Docs Discover Plugins Version 7.8.6 Let's face it, writing MongoDB validation, casting and business logic boilerplate is a drag . That's why we wrote Mongoose. const mongoose = require ( 'mongoose' ); mongoose. connect ( 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/test' ); const Cat = mongoose. model ( 'Cat' , { name : String }); const kitty = new Cat ({ name : 'Zildjian' }); kitty. save (). then ( () => console . log ( 'meow' )); Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
