Functions: connection | Next.js Menu Using App Router Features available in /app Using Latest Version 15.2.2 API Reference Functions connection connection The connection() function allows you to indicate rendering should wait for an incoming user request before continuing. It's useful when a component doesnâ€™t use Dynamic APIs , but you want it to be dynamically rendered at runtime and not statically rendered at build time. This usually occurs when you access external information that you intentionally want to change the result of a render, such as Math.random() or new Date() . app/page.tsx TypeScript JavaScript TypeScript import { connection } from 'next/server' export default async function Page () { await connection () // Everything below will be excluded from prerendering const rand = Math .random () return < span >{rand} </ span > } Reference Type function connection () : Promise < void > Parameters The function does not accept any parameters. Returns The function returns a void Promise. It is not meant to be consumed. Good to know connection replaces unstable_noStore to better align with the future of Next.js. The function is only necessary when dynamic rendering is required and common Dynamic APIs are not used.
