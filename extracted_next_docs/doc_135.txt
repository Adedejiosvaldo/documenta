Directives: use client | Next.js Menu Using App Router Features available in /app Using Latest Version 15.2.2 API Reference Directives use client use client The use client directive designates a component to be rendered on the client side and should be used when creating interactive user interfaces (UI) that require client-side JavaScript capabilities, such as state management, event handling, and access to browser APIs. This is a React feature. Usage To designate a component as a Client Component, add the use client directive at the top of the file , before any imports: app/components/counter.tsx TypeScript JavaScript TypeScript 'use client' import { useState } from 'react' export default function Counter () { const [ count , setCount ] = useState ( 0 ) return ( < div > < p >Count: {count}</ p > < button onClick = {() => setCount (count + 1 )}>Increment</ button > </ div > ) } Nesting Client Components within Server Components Combining Server and Client Components allows you to build applications that are both performant and interactive: Server Components : Use for static content, data fetching, and SEO-friendly elements. Client Components : Use for interactive elements that require state, effects, or browser APIs. Component composition : Nest Client Components within Server Components as needed for a clear separation of server and client logic. In the following example: Header is a Server Component handling static content. Counter is a Client Component enabling interactivity within the page. app/page.tsx TypeScript JavaScript TypeScript import Header from './header' import Counter from './counter' // This is a Client Component export default function Page () { return ( < div > < Header /> < Counter /> </ div > ) } Reference See the React documentation for more information on use client .
