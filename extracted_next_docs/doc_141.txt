File Conventions: not-found.js | Next.js Menu Using App Router Features available in /app Using Latest Version 15.2.2 API Reference File Conventions not-found.js not-found.js The not-found file is used to render UI when the notFound function is thrown within a route segment. Along with serving a custom UI, Next.js will return a 200 HTTP status code for streamed responses, and 404 for non-streamed responses. app/not-found.tsx TypeScript JavaScript TypeScript import Link from 'next/link' export default function NotFound () { return ( < div > < h2 >Not Found</ h2 > < p >Could not find requested resource</ p > < Link href = "/" >Return Home</ Link > </ div > ) } Reference Props not-found.js components do not accept any props. Good to know : In addition to catching expected notFound() errors, the root app/not-found.js file also handles any unmatched URLs for your whole application. This means users that visit a URL that is not handled by your app will be shown the UI exported by the app/not-found.js file. Examples Data Fetching By default, not-found is a Server Component. You can mark it as async to fetch and display data: app/not-found.tsx TypeScript JavaScript TypeScript import Link from 'next/link' import { headers } from 'next/headers' export default async function NotFound () { const headersList = await headers () const domain = headersList .get ( 'host' ) const data = await getSiteData (domain) return ( < div > < h2 >Not Found: { data .name}</ h2 > < p >Could not find requested resource</ p > < p > View < Link href = "/blog" >all posts</ Link > </ p > </ div > ) } If you need to use Client Component hooks like usePathname to display content based on the path, you must fetch data on the client-side instead.
