next.config.js Options: devIndicators | Next.js Menu Using App Router Features available in /app Using Latest Version 15.2.2 Configuration next.config.js Options devIndicators devIndicators devIndicators allows you to configure the on-screen indicator that gives context about the current route you're viewing during development. Types devIndicators : false | { position ?: 'bottom-right' | 'bottom-left' | 'top-right' | 'top-left' , // defaults to 'bottom-left', } , Setting devIndicators to false will hide the indicator, however Next.js will continue to surface any build or runtime errors that were encountered. Troubleshooting Indicator not marking a route as static If you expect a route to be static and the indicator has marked it as dynamic, it's likely the route has opted out of static rendering. You can confirm if a route is static or dynamic by building your application using next build --debug , and checking the output in your terminal. Static (or prerendered) routes will display a ○ symbol, whereas dynamic routes will display a ƒ symbol. For example: Build Output Route (app) Size First Load JS ┌ ○ /_not-found 0 B 0 kB └ ƒ /products/[id] 0 B 0 kB ○ (Static) prerendered as static content ƒ (Dynamic) server-rendered on demand When exporting getServerSideProps or getInitialProps from a page, it will be marked as dynamic.
